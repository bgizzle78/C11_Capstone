## 🎯 Motivation
Happiness is not only a personal concern but also a societal one, influencing productivity, stability, and overall quality of life. Governments and organizations increasingly use happiness measures as part of their decision-making frameworks. By analyzing Global Happiness data, this project seeks to better understand which factors most strongly influence happiness and how these vary across countries and regions. This topic is engaging because it blends economics, sociology, and psychology into measurable data-driven insights.

## 🔧 Acquiring & Normalizing the Data

### 📦 Data Sources
I combined:
- 🌈 World Happiness Report (Country happiness scores and rankings)
- 🌐 World Bank Indicators (GDP, health expenditure, education expenditure)  
- 🗺️ World Bank Country Metadata (regions, income groups, ISO codes)

### 🧹 Cleaning & Normalization Steps
- Standardized WHR columns across years  
- Cleaned and aligned country names and ISO codes  
- Filtered World Bank metrics to relevant indicators  
- Pivoted World Bank data from long ➜ wide format  
- Removed aggregate/invalid regions  
- Synced years and merged everything into a single dataset

## ⚠️ Problems & Challenges
- Country name mismatches 🏳️  
- Messy World Bank indicators requiring heavy reshaping 🔄  
- Sparse or inconsistent years 📉  
- WHR column inconsistencies 🧩
